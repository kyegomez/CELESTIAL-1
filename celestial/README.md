# Architectural Overview

CELESTIAL-1 is designed based on the ONE-PEACE architecture. It is a deep learning model that uses multiple layers of transformers to process and generate representations across multiple modalities such as vision, audio, and language. The model is divided into multiple components:

- **Embedding Layers**: These are the initial layers that take the raw input from each modality and convert them into a representation that can be processed by the model.

- **Transformer Layers**: These are the main components of the model, responsible for transforming the embedded input into higher-level representations. They can process and understand information across multiple modalities.

- **Output Layers**: These are the final layers of the model that take the output of the transformer layers and generate the output of the model in the appropriate format for each modality.

- **Scaling Component**: This part of the architecture is responsible for scaling up the model to handle larger and more complex tasks, while still maintaining its efficiency and effectiveness.

# Step-by-step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the CELESTIAL-1 repository to your local machine using the command `git clone [repository_url]`.

2. **Set Up the Environment**: Create a Python virtual environment and activate it. Then, install the necessary dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Download the Data**: Download the data you want to use for training or testing the model. This data should cover the modalities you are interested in (vision, audio, language, etc.).

4. **Preprocess the Data**: Depending on the modalities and data format, you may need to preprocess the data into a form that can be understood by CELESTIAL-1.

5. **Train the Model**: Using the training script provided in the repository, train the model on your data using the command `python train.py --data [data_path] --checkpoint_dir [checkpoint_directory]`.

6. **Evaluate the Model**: Once the model has been trained, you can evaluate its performance on a test set using the evaluation script provided in the repository.

7. **Use the Model for Inference**: With a trained model, you can now use it for inference on new data. You can use the inference script provided in the repository to do this.

8. **Contribute**: If you make improvements or fixes to the model or codebase, consider contributing back to the project. Follow the contribution guidelines provided in the repository.

Remember, the actual commands and details may vary depending on the specific repository and codebase of CELESTIAL-1.
