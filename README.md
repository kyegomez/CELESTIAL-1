# CELESTIAL-1: A Model for Processing, Understanding, and Reasoning in Unlimited Modalities

CELESTIAL-1 is an open source model designed to provide a general representation for processing, understanding, and reasoning across an unlimited range of modalities. The model is based on the ONE-PEACE architecture, enabling it to effectively operate across a range of modalities including vision, audio, and language. Unlike other models that require pretraining on vision or language tasks, CELESTIAL-1 can operate in vision, audio, audio-language, and vision-language tasks without any prior initialization.

## Features

CELESTIAL-1 boasts a wide range of features designed to enhance its versatility and usefulness. Some of these features include:

* **Unlimited Modalities**: The model can process and understand an unlimited number of modalities, increasing its applicability in a wide range of tasks.
* **Reasoning in Context**: CELESTIAL-1 is capable of reasoning in context across multiple modalities, thus improving its understanding and representation of complex scenarios.
* **Generates Any Modality**: With the ability to generate any modality, CELESTIAL-1 can cater to a wider variety of applications.
* **Scaling-Friendly Architecture**: The architecture of CELESTIAL-1 is designed to be friendly to scaling, which allows it to efficiently handle larger and more complex tasks.
* **Modality-Agnostic Tasks**: The model can perform tasks that are agnostic to the modality, further widening its range of uses.
* **Strong Emergent Zero-Shot Retrieval Capability**: CELESTIAL-1 has an impressive ability to retrieve information in a zero-shot manner, an essential feature for any advanced AI model.

## Usage

The development of CELESTIAL-1 is currently ongoing, and checkpoints, training scripts, inference scripts, and demos will be released as they become available. Please stay tuned for future updates!
