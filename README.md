# CELESTIAL-1: A Model for Processing, Understanding, and Reasoning in Unlimited Modalities

CELESTIAL-1 is an open source general representation model for processing, understanding, and reasoning in unlimited modalities. It is based on the ONE-PEACE architecture, which is designed to work across vision, audio, and language modalities. With no need for any vision or language pretrained model for initialization, CELESTIAL-1 excels in vision, audio, audio-language, and vision-language tasks.

## Features
Can process and understand unlimited modalities
Reasoning in context across multiple modalities
Generates any modality
Scaling-friendly architecture
Modality-agnostic tasks
Strong emergent zero-shot retrieval capability
Usage
CELESTIAL-1 is currently in development and the checkpoints, training & inference scripts, as well as demos will be released as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates!
